INTRODUCTION
------------

Node Link Generator allows Drupal users with the "Administer content" permission 
to mass generate node links in a few clicks. 

Access the content list (admin/content), select some nodes 
and select the "Generate menu links" action.
The module will then present a form so that you can choose in which menu(s) the 
selected node links should be created.

The Node Link Generator module has been created in order to offer a simple way to
mass generate node links in Drupal.
